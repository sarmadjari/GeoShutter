 * Resolves the one name the app displays for a camera.
 *
 * The system display name and the Bluetooth hardware name are separate values,
 * and neither is authoritative on its own. Rather than guessing whether a string
 * looks like a placeholder — which silently overwrote anyone who deliberately
 * named a camera "Camera" — this trusts two facts:
 *
 * - The app sets the AccessorySetupKit display item name to [FALLBACK] itself,
 *   so an accessory name that differs from it can only have been typed by a
 *   person in the system rename sheet.
 * - A rename made in the app is stored with `deviceNameIsCustom`.
 *
 * A custom name is therefore never replaced, while a derived one is upgraded as
 * soon as a real hardware name becomes available (which, for AccessorySetupKit
 * cameras, is only after authorization).
